# CALCULATOR APP USING REACT


## How it's made. 

**Tech Used**: REACT | CSS | JAVASCRIPT | NODE.JS
I had done a regular calculator before but I wanted to redo it using REACT. The unique part about this particular applications is that all of the calcuations are done locally.

## Optimizations
In the future, it would be nice to optimize a few things
- increase overall speed on clicks and loads
- include user preferences with more MongoDB backend
- add additional search features
- take the preferences of the user and use that to build recommendations
- add user login to save previous problems 


## Lessons Learned
A few notes are that it is really diffilcult to add commas to a number before the decimal and remove the formatting after the decimal. Also, I'm sure there are libraries that would of made this project a whole lot easier. I'll try to implement it in the future.
